# Loop-Detection
For a long time, many people want to generate code from sentences automatically. Thanks to machine learning and deep learning, we can try to deal with this problem. As part of efforts to automatically generate code, we predict whether loop will be used in the code when a sentence is given.
To find loop, we use Neural Network ,Goggle Sentence Encoder ,whole sentences(Codingbat.com)
